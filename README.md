# Neural-Dimensionality-Reduction
In this notebook, we will analyze how dimensionality reduction can be performed using a neural network. Dimensionality reduction is a crucial aspect of data analysis as it simplifies complex datasets, reduces noise, improves data visualization, and decreases computation times for machine learning models.
